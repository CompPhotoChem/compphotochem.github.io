description: "Today I started my position as tenure track junior professor for the theory of electronically excited states at FAU Erlangen-Nuremberg! It has been an exciting journey through academia, starting with a PhD at the Friedrich Schiller University Jena and the Leibniz Institute for Photonic Technologies with Benjamin Dietzek-Ivansic, followed by a PostDoc period in Jena and as a Feodor Lynen Researcher of the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation at the University of Luxembourg with Alexandre Tkatchenko, and now the creation of my own group.
<br>
I am super grateful for this fantastic opportunity to pursue my own research at the age of just 28! A big thank you goes out to all the people who have supported and encouraged me and with whom I have collaborated over the years! Without you, this would not have been possible!"
