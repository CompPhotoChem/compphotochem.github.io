description: "Iâ€™m delighted to share that we had a fantastic and engaging CECAM Flagship Workshop in Lausanne: Beyond Ground State Simulations: Navigating Challenges in Excited States of Extended Molecules and Materials (November 5-8, 2024).
<br><br>
A heartfelt thank you to all participants for their active contributions! Through our four working groups, we discussed key challenges in describing charge transfer and long-range interactions, performing non-adiabatic molecular dynamics,
and integrating machine learning. It was truly inspiring to see such collaborative effort in advancing our understanding of excited states in complex molecular and material systems."
