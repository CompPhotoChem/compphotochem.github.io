description: "How does Near-Infrared-Photoswitching work? Our newest research delivers an ultrafast molecular movie of the all-red-light photoswitch peri-Anthracenethioindigo (PAT) in action! 
Guided by excited-state simulations, its mechanism of motion is fully revealed. 
We show that PAT double bond rotation occurs exclusively from the triplet state â€“ but it is stable in air due to very favorable energy levels.
