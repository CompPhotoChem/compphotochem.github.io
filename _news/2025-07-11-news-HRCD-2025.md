description: "It was a great honor to be one of the recipients of the Hector Research Career Development Award this year. 
The ceremony took place in Düsseldorf and celebrated early-career researchers pushing the boundaries in their fields. 
Alongside Dr. Sofie Valk (cognitive neuroscience, right) and Dr. Carolin Victoria Schneider (digital medicine, middle), 
I was recognized for my work in theoretical chemistry. 
I also had the pleasure of giving a dinner speech, where I spoke about my research on selective energy transfer catalysis—focusing on how this 
strategy helps us navigate donor–acceptor pair selection and optimize reaction conditions to streamline the synthesis of selective isomers. 
It was a truly inspiring evening of science and exchange.
