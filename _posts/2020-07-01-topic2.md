description: In our research group, we are dedicated to tackling the intricate challenges that arise when dealing with mechanistic modeling of multivariate data, especially those exceeding three dimensions. The underlying complexities can often obscure the mechanisms at play. Our mission is clear: to unravel this complexity. We focus on extracting invaluable mechanistic insights from multivariate spectroscopic data, with a specific emphasis on time-resolved spectra. To achieve this, we harness the power of chemometric and machine learning techniques. Through methods like multivariate curve resolution, principal component analysis, and neural networks, we aim to decode the underlying mechanisms.
