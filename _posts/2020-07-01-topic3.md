description: "Our group specializes in the challenging realm of predicting photoinduced phenomena: While machine learning architectures achieve accurate predictions, building vast chemical databases from quantum chemical reference calculations poses limitations. Our mission is to transfer knowledge gained from simulations into processing experimental data, and <i>vice versa</i>, enabling us to systematically calculate relevant structures. Through automated knowledge transfer between quantum chemistry and multivariate modeling of experimental data, we develop fast workflows for understanding and optimizing excited state properties. Our goal is to construct comprehensive databases and data-driven strategies for designing molecules and materials with desired excited state properties, such as optical characteristics."
