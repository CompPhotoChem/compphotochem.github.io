description: TD-DFT (Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory) is a computational method used in quantum chemistry to study electronic excitations. It extends the widely used DFT method to calculate excited states and transitions. TD-DFT treats excited states as perturbations on the ground state and uses the time-dependent electron density to describe them. It is used to analyze absorption spectra, electronic transitions, and optical properties in various fields.
