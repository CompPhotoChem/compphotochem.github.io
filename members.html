        <p>Carolin Müller joined the University of Luxembourg (LUX) as a Feodor Lynen postdoctoral researcher of the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation in the Theoretical Chemical Physics group led by
          Alexandre Tkatchenko in June 2022. 
          Prior to this, she spent a year as a postdoctoral researcher in the group of Benjamin Dietzek-Ivanšić at the Institute of Physical Chemistry, Friedrich Schiller University Jena (GER). 
          Her academic journey began at Friedrich Schiller University Jena (GER) and Dublin City University (IRL), where she completed her Bachelor (2013-2016) and Master of Science (2016-2018)
          degree in chemistry. 
          Between 2018 and 2021, she completed her doctoral studies at the same university under the guidance of Benjamin Dietzek-Ivanšić at the Institute of Physical Chemistry.
          Her accomplishments were recognized with prestigious awards, namely, Thuringian Research Award from the Thüringer Ministerium für Wirtschaft, Wissenschaft und Digitale Gesellschaft, the
          Albert-Weller Award from the Division of Photochemistry of the German Chemical Society (GDCh) and the German Bunsen-Society (DBG), as well as the Dissertation Award from the Faculty of
          Chemistry and Earth Sciences at Friedrich Schiller University Jena. 
          Furthermore, she has secured notable grants to support her research, including the Feodor Lynen Research Fellowship from the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation (2021), the Kekulé Fellowship
          from the Fonds der Chemischen Industrie (2019), the PROMOS Scholarship from the German Academic Exchange Service (2018), and the Deutschlandstipendium from Friedrich Schiller University
          Jena (2016).
